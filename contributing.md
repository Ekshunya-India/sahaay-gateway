## Testing

We have a handful of Cucumber features. Please create BDD test for the features that you are adding. We will love you if you add more BDD/integration/unit tests in general. We can always use more test coverage.  

## Submitting changes
People are welcome to create feature request and start adding code to this and creating PR's. The process of adding a feature is 
[Issues](https://github.com/Ekshunya-India/sahaay/issues) =>>> [Action-Items](https://github.com/Ekshunya-India/sahaay/actions) =>>> [Pull-Requests](https://github.com/Ekshunya-India/sahaay/pulls )
There will hopefully be a way to reward users who create new Issues/Feature Requests, Developers Move it from Action Item to PR's. Like a company coin of sorts. More Complexity an Issue/Feature-Request more coins it gets. Should be distributable among many developers who work as a team.


Create a Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

We try to follow standard Java Coding convention. We belive that Google Style Guide serves this purpose very well. You can see it [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) Kindly have the google formatter installed on your IDE for best result. [Google Formatter](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)

## Rewards
This will have an internal/automated reward system for contributers. You can contribute to the system in many ways. Every contribution to the product will be measured and correspondingly rewarded. Contribution can come in the form of users who create new Issues/Feature Requests, Developers who move it from Action Item to PR's, Even users who list problem/stories and Users who help solve these problems.  Like company coins [Sahaay Coins](https://github.com/Ekshunya-India/sahaay-coins). 

Reward mechanism still needs to be looked at deeper. Some Questions that needs to be answered are: 
1. How will more complex issue/feature be rewarded? vs simple issues/feature. 
2. How will more priority issues be rewarded? vs less priority issues.
3. How will high priority help request be rewarded vs less priority help?
4. How will a solution to a "High Impact Problem" vs "Low Impact problem" be rewarded?
